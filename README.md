==============

Welcome to Jelly Builds
---------

JellyCastle builds enable Maven build configuration via Java annotations.

Why should someone do something like this? Maven has been and is still a well known standard
for Java build lifecylces. The painful experience with this approach is developers having to deal
with huge amount of XML configuration files that Maven produces.

Jelly castle as a framework uses the new Maven 3.3.1 core extension mechanism in order to enable
Maven configuration as Java annotations. We think the build configuration and build information on dependencies,
plugins and properties should be part of the code base. Writing and using Java annotations has become to a natural
daily work business for all Java developers out there. So it is natural to also use this well known and accepted
meta data information to specify how to build and run the application.
